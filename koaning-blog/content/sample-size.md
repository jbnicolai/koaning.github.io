<!-- Title: Sample Size Guesstimation -->
Date: 2016-02-07

I've made a small shiny app. It is located [here](https://koaning.shinyapps.io/ab_testing/) but will also render below. It is meant to help people determine an appropriate sample size for their AB tests. It will assume that a CTR is fixed during an AB test but will allow you to generate ballpark figures for how long an AB test needs to run, given your preferences. 

If you don't achieve your preferable odds, consider raising the number of days that you run the experiment.
