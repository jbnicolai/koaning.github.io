title: R got good at scraping

R may just have become more preferable for simple webscraping jobs with the release of `rvest`. Before, this was something I'd prefer to do in python but the new R syntax seems to prevail. In this document I will give a small example of it's syntax. 

### Dependencies 

	library(rvest)
	library(stringr)
	library(dplyr)
	library(ggplot2)
	library(GGally)

### Heroes of the storm

We will be scraping information on video game characters from [heroes of the storm](http://eu.battle.net/heroes/en/), a popular brawler game made by Blizzard. We'll be scraping a [fan website](http://www.heroesnexus.com/heroes) to get the information we want. 

We retrieve the website simply via the `html` method. 

	heroes <- html("http://www.heroesnexus.com/heroes")


This page contains many html nodes which have classes. These are very useful for scraping and can be accessed via a css-selector string in `html_nodes`. The text of these nodes can then be accessed via `html_text`. If you need a reminder of useful selectors, [this](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048) source might help.


	df <- data.frame(
	  name = heroes %>% html_nodes("a.hero-champion") %>% html_text, 
	  hp_txt = heroes %>% html_nodes(".visual-quickinfo-cell .hero-hp") %>% html_text,
	  attack_txt = heroes %>% html_nodes(".visual-quickinfo-cell .hero-atk") %>% html_text,
	  role = heroes %>% html_nodes(".role") %>% html_text,
	  attack_type = heroes %>% html_nodes(".hero-type :not(.role)") %>% html_text
	)


The nodes that we've retreived now only need to be extracted for numerical value. Through `mutate` we perform some etl together with some functions from `stringr`. If `\\d*` confuses you: don't worry. It's a thing called a regex: go [here](http://www.regexr.com/) if you want to know more. 

	df <- df %>% 
	  mutate(hp = hp_txt %>% str_extract("(HP: \\d*)") %>% 
	           str_replace("HP: ", "") %>% as.numeric,
	         attack = attack_txt %>% str_extract("(Damage: \\d.\\d*)") %>% 
	           str_replace("Damage: ", "") %>% as.numeric,
	         attack_spd = attack_txt %>% str_extract("(Speed: \\d\\.?\\d*)") %>% 
	           str_replace("Speed: ", "") %>% as.numeric)

Now that the dataframe is done, let's go for some massive visual exploring with `GGally`.

	df %>% 
	  select(hp, attack, attack_spd, attack_type) %>% 
	  ggpairs(data=., color = "attack_type", title="stats by melee/ranged")

![](/theme/images/heroes1.png)

	df %>% 
	  select(hp, attack, attack_spd, role) %>% 
	  ggpairs(data=., color = "role", title="stats by role")

![](/theme/images/heroes2.png)

Specialist and support heroes don't deal as much damage as assassins or warriors. Melee characters also seem to pack more of a punch. All these numbers make sense from a game balance perspective.

### Conclusion 

So in about 20 lines of (very straightforward) code we have;

- retreived the html of a website 
- parsed through the html to find nodes of interest
- parsed the nodes of interest
- visualised the result with two plots

In python, I would need to use beautiful soup as well as requests and matplotlib to get to a similar result, both of which feel like different styles of api. This is something R is becomming very good at, the entire language feels as the same api. 

The `html_nodes` function feels lovely if you **just** want to quickly select a few things based of css-selectors. It plays very nicely with the `%>%` operator too. It even has support for rare css-selectors like `:not`. Very cool.

R and python: always contending.
