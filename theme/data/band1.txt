i talk to you every now and then
i never felt so alone again
i stop to think at a wishing well
my thoughts send me on a carousel
here i am standing on my own
not a motion from the telephone
i know not a reason why
solitudes a reason to die
just you wait and see
as school life is a
it is a woken dream
aren't you feeling alone?
i guess its just another
i guess its just another
i guess its just another night alone
now as i walk down the street
i need a job just to sleep in sheets
buying food every once in a while
but not enough to purchase a smile
a tank of gas is a treasure to me
i know now that nothing is free
i talk to you every now and then
i never felt so alone again
just you wait and see
as school life is a
it is a woken dream
aren't you feeling alone?
i guess its just another
i guess its just another
i guess its just another night alone
you and i should get away for awhile
i just want to be alone with your smile
buy some candy and cigarettes and we'll get in my car
we'll blast the stereo and we'll drive to madagascar
because when i'm with you there's nothing i wouldn't do
i just want to be your only one
i'm grasping out at straws thinking back to what i saw
that night on the floor when we were all alone
my love life was getting so bland
there are only so many ways i can make love with my hand
sometimes it makes me want to laugh
sometimes i want to take my toaster in the bath
because when i'm with you there's nothing i wouldn't do
i just want to be your only one
i'm grasping out at straws thinking back to what i saw
that night on the floor when we were all alone
who's gonna be the odd man out?
i don't want to be the odd man out
is this going to be the end
or are you going to be my new girlfriend?
it's alright / to tell me / what you think / about me
i won't try / to argue / or hold it / against you
i know that / you're leaving / you must have / your reasons
the season / is calling / and your pictures / are falling down
the steps that / i retrace / the sad look / on your face
the timing / and structure / did you hear / he fucked her?
a day late / a buck short / i'm writing / the report
on losing / and failing / when i move / i'm flailing now
and it's happened once again
i'll turn to a friend
someone that understands
sees through the master plan
but everybody's gone
and i've been here for too long
to face this on my own
well i guess this is growing up
well i guess this is growing up
and maybe / i'll see you / at a movie / sneak preview
you'll show up / and walk by / on the arm / of that guy
and i'll smile / and you'll wave / we'll pretend / it's okay
the charade / it won't last / when he's gone / i won't come back
and it'll happen once again
you'll turn to a friend
someone that understands
and sees through the master plan
but everybody's gone
and you've been there for too long
to face this on your own
well i guess this is growing up
well, i guess this is growing up
well, i guess this is growing up
well, i guess this is growing up
well, i guess this is growing up
well, i guess this is growing up
yeah, my girlfriend takes me home when i'm too drunk to drive
and she doesn't get all jealous when i hang out with the guys
she laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
she brings me mexican food from sombrero's just because
(yeah, just because)
and my girlfriend likes u.l. and d.h.c.
and she's so smart and independent, i don't think she needs me
quite half as much as i know i need her
i wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer
and when i feel like giving up
like my world is falling down
i show up at 3 am
she's still up watching vacation, and i
see her pretty face
it takes me away to a better place and
(i know that everything [3x]) everything's gonna be fine
(i know that everything [3x]) everything's gonna be fine
yeah, my girlfriend takes collect calls from the road
and it doesn't seem to matter that i'm lacking in the bulge
she laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
she brings me mexican food from sombrero's just because
and when i feel like giving up
like my world is falling down
i show up at 3 am
she's still up watching vacation, and i
see her pretty face
it takes me away to a better place and
(i know that everything [3x]) everything's gonna be fine
(i know that everything [3x]) everything's gonna be fine
(i know that everything [3x]) everything's gonna be fine
(i know that everything [3x]) everything's gonna be fine
(i know that everything [3x]) everything's gonna be fine
(i know that everything [3x]) everything's gonna be fine
(i know that everything [3x]) everything's gonna be fine
(i know that everything [3x]) everything's gonna be fine
i took her out it was friday night
i wore cologne to get the feeling right
we started making out and she took off my pants
but then i turned on the tv
and that's about the time that she walked away from me
nobody likes you when you're 23
and are still more amused by tv shows
what the hell is a.d.d.?
my friends say i should act my age
what's my age again?
what's my age again?
then later on, on the drive home
i called her mom from a pay phone
i said i was the cops
and your husband's in jail
this state looks down on sodomy
and that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
nobody likes you when you're 23
and are still more amused by prank phone calls
what the hell is caller id?
my friends say i should act my age
what's my age again?
what's my age again?
and that's about the time she walked away from me
nobody likes you when you're 23
and you still act like you're in freshman year
what the hell is wrong with me?
my friends say i should act my age
what's my age again?
what's my age again?
that's about the time she broke up with me
no one should take themselves so seriously
with many years ahead to fall in line
why would you wish that on me?
i never want to act my age
what's my age again?
what's my age again?
what's my age again?
all the / small things
true care / truth brings
i'll take / one lift
your ride / best trip
always / i know
you'll be / at my show
watching, waiting, commiserating
say it ain't so, i will not go
turn the lights off, carry me home
na, na, na, na....
late night, come home
work sucks, i know
she left me roses by the stairs
surprises let me know she cares
say it ain't so, i will not go
turn the lights off, carry me home
na, na, na, na....
say it ain't so, i will not go
turn the lights off, carry me home
keep your head still, i'll be your thrill
the night will go on, my little windmill
say it ain't so, i will not go
turn the lights off, carry me home
keep your head still, i'll be your thrill
the night will go on,
the night will go on,
my little windmill
i never thought i'd die alone
i laughed the loudest who'd have known?
i trace the cord back to the wall
no wonder it was never plugged in at all
i took my time, i hurried up
the choice was mine i didn't think enough
i'm too depressed to go on
you'll be sorry when i'm gone
i never conquered, rarely came
16 just held such better days
days when i still felt alive
we couldn't wait to get outside
the world was wide, too late to try
the tour was over, we'd survived
i couldn't wait till i got home
to pass the time in my room alone
i never thought i'd die alone
another six months i'll be unknown
give all my things to all my friends
you'll never step foot in my room again
you'll close it off, board it up
remember the time that i spilled the cup
of apple juice in the hall
please tell mom this is not her fault
i never conquered, rarely came
16 just held such better days
days when i still felt alive
we couldn't wait to get outside
the world was wide, too late to try
the tour was over, we'd survived
i couldn't wait till i got home
to pass the time in my room alone
i never conquered, rarely came
tomorrow holds such better days
days when i can still feel alive
when i can't wait to get outside
the world is wide, the time goes by
the tour is over, i've survived
i can't wait till i get home
to pass the time in my room alone
so sorry, it's over
so sorry, it's over
there's so much more that i wanted and (so sorry, it's over)
there's so much more that i needed and
time keeps moving on and on and on... (so sorry, it's over)
soon we'll all be gone
let's take some time to talk this over
you're outta line and rarely sober
we can't depend, on your excuses
because in the end it's fucking useless
you can only lean, on me for so long
bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
sittin' out on a ledge, begged you to come down
you can only lean, on me for so long
i remember shots without a chaser
absent minded thoughts now you're a stranger
cover up the scars, put on your game face
left you in a bar, to try and save face
you can only lean, on me for so long
bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
sittin' out on a ledge, begged you to come down
you can only lean, on me for so long
so sorry, it's over
so sorry, it's over
there's so much more that i wanted and (so sorry, it's over)
there's so much more that i needed and
time keeps moving on and on and on... (so sorry, it's over)
soon we'll all be gone
man on a mission
can't say i miss him around
insider information
hand in your resignation
loss of a good friend
best of intentions i found
tight lipped procrastination
ya, later... see you around
hanging out behind the club on the weekend
acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
i couldn't wait for the summer and the warped tour
i remember it's the first time that i saw her there
she's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing
i'm kind of nervous cause i think all her friends hate me
she's the one, she'll always be there
she took my hand and that made it i swear
because i fell in love with the girl at the rock show
she said "what?" and i told her that i didn't know
she's so cool, i'm gonna sneak in through her window
everything's better when she's around
i can't wait till her parents go out of town
i fell in love with the girl at the rock show
when we said we were gonna move to vegas
i remember the look her mother gave us
seventeen without a purpose or direction
we don't owe anyone a fucking explanation
i fell in love with the girl at the rock show
she said "what?" and i told her that i didn't know
she's so cool, i'm gonna sneak in through her window
everything's better when she's around
i can't wait till her parents go out of town
i fell in love with the girl at the rock show
black and white picture of her on my wall
i waited for her call
she always kept me waiting
and if i ever got another chance
i'd still ask her to dance
because she kept me waiting
i fell in love with the girl at the rock show
she said "what?" and i told her that i didn't know
she's so cool, i'm gonna sneak in through her window
everything's better when she's around
i can't wait till her parents go out of town
i fell in love with the girl at the rock show
with the girl at the rock show
with the girl at the rock show
(i'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
(i'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
(i'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
(i'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
(i'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
in the car i just can't wait
to pick you up on our very first date
is it cool if i hold your hand?
is it wrong if i think it's lame to dance?
do you like my stupid hair?
would you guess that i didn't know what to wear?
i'm just scared of what you think
you make me nervous so i really can't eat
let's go
don't wait
this nights almost over
honest, let's make
this night last forever
forever and ever
let's make this last forever
forever and ever
let's make this last forever
when you smile, i melt inside
i'm not worthy for a minute of your time
i really wish it was only me and you
i'm jealous of everybody in the room
please don't look at me with those eyes
please don't hint that you're capable of lies
i dread the thought of our very first kiss
a target that i'm probably gonna miss
let's go
don't wait
this nights almost over
honest, let's make
this night last forever
forever and ever
let's make this last forever
forever and ever
let's make this last forever
let's go
don't wait
this nights almost over
honest, let's make
this night last forever
forever and ever
let's make this last forever
forever and ever
let's make this last forever
forever and ever
let's make this last forever
forever and ever
let's make this last forever
it's hard to wake up
when the shades have been pulled shut
this house is haunted
it's so pathetic
it makes no sense at all
i'm ripe with things to say
the words rot and fall away
what stupid poem could fix this home
i'd read it every day
so here's your holiday
hope you enjoy it this time
you gave it all away
it was mine
so when you're dead and gone
will you remember this night
twenty years now lost
it's not right
their anger hurts my ears
been running strong for seven years
rather than fix the problems
they never solve them
it makes no sense at all
i see them everyday
we get along, so why can't they?
if this is what he wants
and this is what she wants
then why is there so much pain?
so here's your holiday
hope you enjoy it this time
you gave it all away
it was mine
so when you're dead and gone
will you remember this night
twenty years now lost
it's not right
so here's your holiday
hope you enjoy it this time
you gave it all away
it was mine
so when you're dead and gone
will you remember this night
twenty years now lost
it's not right
it's not right
it's not right
it's not right
i got no regret right now (i'm feeling this)
the air is so cold and low (i'm feeling this)
let me go in her room (i'm feeling this)
i wanna take off her clothes (i'm feeling this)
show me the way to bed (i'm feeling this)
show me the way you move (i'm feeling this)
fuck it, it's such a blur (i'm feeling this)
i love all the things you do (i'm feeling this)
fate fell short this time
your smile fades in the summer
place your hand in mine
i'll leave when i wanna
where do we go from here
turn all the lights down now
smiling from ear to ear (i'm feeling this)
our breathing has got too loud (i'm feeling this)
show me the bedroom floor (i'm feeling this)
show me the bathroom mirror (i'm feeling this)
were taking this way too slow (i'm feeling this)
take me away from here (i'm feeling this)
fate fell short this time
your smile fades in the summer
place your hand in mine
i'll leave when i wanna
(fate fell short this time
your smile fades in the summer
place your hand in mine
i'll leave when i wanna)
this place was never the same again after you came and went
how can you say you meant anything different
to anyone standing alone on the street
with a cigarette on the first night we met
look to the past and remember her smile
and maybe tonight i can breathe for awhile
i'm not in this scene i think i'm falling asleep
but then all that it needs is i'll always be dreaming of you
fate fell short this time
your smile fades in the summer
place your hand in mine
i'll leave when i wanna
fate fell short this time (fate fell short this time)
your smile fades in the summer (your smile fades in the summer)
place your hand in mine (place your hand in mine)
i'll leave when i wanna (i'll leave when i wanna)
fate fell short this time (fate fell short this time)
your smile fades in the summer (your smile fades in the summer) (so lost and disillusioned)
place your hand in mine (place your hand in mine)
i'll leave when i wanna (i'll leave when i wanna) (so lost and disillusioned)
fate fell short this time (fate fell short this time) (are we alone, do you feel it)
your smile fades in the summer (your smile fades in the summer) (so lost and disillusioned)
place your hand in mine (place your hand in mine) (are we alone, do you feel it)
i'll leave when i wanna (i'll leave when i wanna) (so lost and disillusioned)
fate fell short this time (are we alone, do you feel it)
your smile fades in the summer (so lost and disillusioned)
place your hand in mine (are we alone, do you feel it)
i'll leave when i wanna (so lost and disillusioned)
hello there, the angel from my nightmare
the shadow in the background of the morgue
the unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
we can live like jack and sally if we want
where you can always find me
we'll have halloween on christmas
and in the night we'll wish this never ends
we'll wish this never ends
(i miss you, miss you)
(i miss you, miss you)
where are you and i'm so sorry
i cannot sleep, i cannot dream tonight
i need somebody and always
this sick strange darkness
comes creeping on so haunting every time
and as i stared i counted
webs from all the spiders
catching things and eating their insides
like indecision to call you
and hear your voice of treason
will you come home and stop this pain tonight
stop this pain tonight
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head (i miss you, miss you)
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head (i miss you, miss you)
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head (i miss you, miss you)
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head (i miss you, miss you)
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head (i miss you, miss you)
don't waste your time on me you're already
the voice inside my head (i miss you, miss you)
(i miss you, miss you)
(i miss you, miss you)
(i miss you, miss you)
(i miss you, miss you)
the drops of rain they fall all over
this awkward silence makes me crazy
the glow inside burns light upon her
i'll try to kiss you if you let me
(this can't be the end)
tidal waves they rip right through me
tears from eyes worn cold and sad
pick me up now, i need you so bad
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
(it gets me so)
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
(it gets me so)
your vows of silence fall all over
the look in your eyes makes me crazy
i feel the darkness break upon her
i'll take you over if you let me
(you did this)
tidal waves they rip right through me
tears from eyes worn cold and sad
pick me up now, i need you so bad
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
(it gets me so)
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
down down down down
(it gets me so)

that you are the one who's left behind

my one last breath, and don't forget
that i will be right here, waiting
i always flirt with death
i could kill but i don't care about it
i can face your threats
stand up tall and scream and shout about it
i think i'm on another world with you, with you
i'm on another planet with you, with you
you always get under my skin
i don't find it irritating
you always play to win
i don't need rehabilitating
i think i'm on another world with you, with you
i'm on another planet with you, with you
another girl, another planet
another girl, another planet
space travel's in my blood
and there ain't nothing i can do about it
long journeys wear me out but
oh god, you know we won't live without it
i think i'm on another world with you, with you
i'm on another planet with you, with you
i think i'm on another world with you, with you
i'm on another planet with you, with you
another girl is loving you now
another planet forever holding you down
another planet
